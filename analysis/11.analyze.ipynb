    "\n",
    "Mozzarellm is a Python package that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze gene clusters for pathway identification and novel gene discovery. This notebook guides you through the process of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading and reshaping gene cluster data** from your OPS screen\n",
    "2. **Analyzing gene clusters with LLMs** to identify biological pathways\n",
    "3. **Categorizing genes** as established pathway members, uncharacterized, or having novel potential roles\n",
    "4. **Prioritizing candidates** for experimental validation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package Installation\n",
    "You need to install the mozzarellm package in your Brieflow environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/mozzarellm.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Keys\n",
    "Mozzarellm requires API keys to access LLM services. You need at least one of these keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for GPT models (gpt-4o, gpt-4.5, etc.)\n",
    "- **Anthropic API Key**: Required for Claude models (claude-3-7-sonnet, etc.)\n",
    "- **Google API Key**: Required for Gemini models (gemini-2.0-pro, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "These keys provide access to paid API services, and usage will incur costs based on the number of tokens processed. The cost per analysis varies by model but typically ranges from $0.01-$0.10 per cluster, depending on cluster size and model choice. For this reason, we only run these analyses on a specific chosen Leiden resolution, rather than across all of the generated possible resolutions."

    "# Feature Plot Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature plots provide powerful visualization methods to understand the phenotypic effects of gene knockdowns in your OPS screen. These visualizations help identify patterns, correlations, and outliers in your data. While the LLM analysis identifies biological pathways and gene functions at a high level, feature plots reveal the specific phenotypic changes caused by individual gene perturbations. This section demonstrates how to create four types of visualizations for specific genes and features:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Waterfall Plots\n",
    "Waterfall plots rank genes by their effect on a single feature, creating a cascade visualization that highlights the genes with the strongest positive or negative effects.\n",
    "- Identifying top hits for a phenotype of interest\n",
    "- Comparing the magnitude of effects across genes\n",
    "- Visualizing the distribution of effects across the entire dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Two-Feature Plots\n",
    "Two-feature plots display the relationship between two different phenotypic measurements across genes.\n",
    "- Discover correlations between different cellular phenotypes\n",
    "- Identify genes that affect multiple features in interesting ways\n",
    "- Cluster genes with similar phenotypic profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Volcano Plots\n",
    "Volcano plots combine effect size (fold change) and statistical significance (p-value) in a single visualization.\n",
    "- Distinguishing between statistically significant and biologically relevant effects\n",
    "- Identifying genes with both strong and reliable phenotypic changes\n",
    "- Establishing appropriate thresholds for hit selection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Heatmaps\n",
    "Heatmaps visualize multiple features across multiple genes simultaneously, providing a comprehensive view of phenotypic signatures.\n",
    "- Revealing patterns across large sets of genes and features\n",
    "- Identifying clusters of genes with similar phenotypic profiles\n",
    "- Comparing the effects of gene perturbations across different cell compartments or processes\n",
    "\n",
    "These visualizations are created interactively in this notebook rather than through the automated Snakemake pipeline because the number of possible plot combinations is enormous (genes × features × plot types). Different analyses require different combinations based on your specific biological questions, and interactive exploration allows you to focus on the most interesting results from your study."
